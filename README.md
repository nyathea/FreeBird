## Project Abandoned
Im no longer working on this project but a few people are continuing from where i left off. check out [NeoFreeBird](https://github.com/actuallyaridan/NeoFreeBird) :3 

# FreeBird
FreeBird is an custom IPA of twitter that aims to remove as much X branding and text as possible as well as remove unnecessary changes.

This is done by patching files in the offical ipa with ones from pre-X versions of twitter. (you might still find refrences to X and "posts" in some places.)

BHTwitter is injected in the IPA as-well so you can block twitter ads and more.
